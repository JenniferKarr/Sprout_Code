The code is written in a combination of C and python, for portability
and affordability. It has successfully been installed on several
flavours of Linux and OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Feedback for
installation on other platforms would be appreciated.

Software Requirements

You need python 2.6 or 2.7 and swig installed. In addition, the python
packages Tkinter, pylab, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pyfits, Pmw,
pickle, os, string and sys are called.  To test for installed
packages, the included script “test_packages.py” can be used.

	> ./test_packages.py

which will produce a list of any packages that need to be
installed. To test for the presence of swig

	> which swig

will determine if you have it installed. If not, it can be downloaded
at www.swig.org,

Installing the Code

The code can be downloaded at ??. On a *nix system (including OSX) the
following commands will compile the C code and link it with the python
code.

	> gunzip sprout.tar.gz
	> tar -xf sprout.tar
	> cd Sprout_Code
	> swig -python ccodes.i	
	> ./setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will place the files in the local directory. If you are redoing
the installation for some reason, then enter

	> rm -rf build _ccodes.so ccodes_wrap.c ccodes.py *pyc

to clear out intermediate files before re-executing the swig
command. Once the program is compiled and running, you can delete the
source code and created installation files.

If you want to put the files in another location 

	> cp *.py  dust_library.pickle Install_Directory/

where Install_Directory is the directory you want to place the
software. Make sure that the Install_Directory is defined in your
path. You can then delete the source code and intermediate files:

	>rm -rf *.c build/ *.h _ccodes.so ccodes.i

Executing the python setup script, test_packages.py and the Sprout
programs will automatically use the python installation from your PATH
variable. If you want to over-ride this with a specific version of
python, explicitly run the programs with that version of python,
instead of running the python as an executable. E.g.,

	> python2.7 test_packages.py

Demo Files

Included with the code is a set of example files. The directory
“Model_Example” contains a small run of data, to test the use of the
view_models.py. The file “Model_Example.pkl” contains a save file for
the parameters, that can be loaded into
run_models.py. psf_example.fits contains an example PSF (derived from
Subaru HICIAO observations). The file “test_data.fits” contains a FITS
file that can be loaded into the viewer.

In addition, there is the script make_movies.sh (described in the
“Making Movies” section of the manual).
